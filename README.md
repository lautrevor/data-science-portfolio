## **Data Science Portfolio**

Hi, I’m **Trevor Lau** — a UBC undergraduate working toward a specialization in Data Science. I’m interested in using data to analyze real-world systems, uncover patterns, and support better decision-making.

This repository contains selected projects that demonstrate my growing skills in:

- **Data cleaning and preprocessing**
- **Exploratory data analysis (EDA)**
- **Statistical reasoning and inference**
- **Data visualization for insight and communication**
- **Applying machine learning models responsibly**

Each project emphasizes clear problem formulation, transparent methods, and interpretable results.

## **Projects**

### Project 1: KNN Regression – Student Performance
Predicting final grades using KNN with feature scaling and model evaluation.

Skills: Python, pandas, scikit-learn, RMSE, model tuning

### Project 2: (Coming) Technical Indicators & VFV
Testing whether common technical indicators improve out-of-sample return prediction.
## **Tools & Technologies**
