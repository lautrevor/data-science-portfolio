## **Data Science Portfolio**

Hi, I’m **Trevor Lau** — a UBC undergraduate working toward a specialization in Data Science. I’m interested in using data to analyze real-world systems, evaluate claims critically, and support better decision-making through disciplined analysis.

This repository contains selected projects that demonstrate my growing skills in:

- **Data cleaning and preprocessing**
- **Exploratory data analysis (EDA)**
- **Statistical reasoning and inference**
- **Data visualization for insight and communication**
- **Applying machine learning models responsibly**

Each project emphasizes clear problem formulation, transparent methods, and honest interpretation of results, with a focus on separating signal from noise.

## **Projects**

### **Project 1: KNN Regression — Student Performance**
Predicted student final grades using K-Nearest Neighbors regression with feature scaling and hyperparameter tuning. The project evaluates model performance using out-of-sample error metrics and discusses limitations of distance-based models in noisy, real-world data.

**Skills:** Python, pandas, scikit-learn, feature scaling, RMSE, model evaluation

### **Project 2: Signal vs Noise in Technical Indicators (VFV)**
Evaluated whether commonly used return-based technical indicators provide meaningful out-of-sample predictive value for next-day returns of VFV (Vanguard S&P 500 Index ETF). Using time-aware train/test splits and baseline comparisons, the analysis finds no meaningful improvement over naive predictors, highlighting the difficulty of short-horizon return prediction.

**Skills:** Time-series analysis, feature engineering, linear regression, baseline modeling, RMSE/MAE, financial data analysis
