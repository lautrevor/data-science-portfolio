        "Financial markets are often believed to contain exploitable patterns that can be identified using technical indicators such as moving averages, momentum, and volatility measures. These indicators are widely used by retail traders and frequently presented as tools that can improve short-term return prediction.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, financial time series are noisy, highly stochastic, and influenced by a wide range of unpredictable factors. As a result, it is unclear whether common technical indicators provide meaningful predictive information beyond simple baseline assumptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "This project investigates whether widely used technical indicators add predictive value for next-day returns of VFV (Vanguard S&P 500 Index ETF), compared to naive return-based baselines. Rather than attempting to construct a trading strategy, the goal is to evaluate signal versus noise using a disciplined, out-of-sample modeling approach.\n",
        "\n",
        "By focusing on proper target construction, time-aware train/test splits, and honest performance evaluation, this analysis aims to assess whether these indicators offer real informational value or whether their apparent usefulness is largely illusory."
