# KNN Regression: Predicting Student Final Grades

## Problem
This project uses K-Nearest Neighbors regression to predict a student's final grade (G3) based on study behavior, attendance, and prior academic performance.

## Data
The dataset contains student academic records including study time, absences, and grades from earlier terms. The target variable is the final grade (G3).

## Methods
- Train/test split
- Feature scaling using StandardScaler
- KNN regression
- Hyperparameter tuning for k
- Model evaluation using RMSE
